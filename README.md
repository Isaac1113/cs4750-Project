# fomo_app

This project uses flutter to develop an app to help players deal with FOMO, Fear Of Missing Out, in games that they play. This app was made for winter session of the course CS4750, Mobile App Development.

# What is it?

This app is a basic implementation of how I would like to bea able to keep track of the FOMO aspects in the games that I play.

# How does the App work?

The app lets a user create an account that is stored in a Firebase Firestore database, which can then be used to browse through the games that are listed in the database. A user then has a choice to adding that game to their library, which is stored in the database. The app will display the weekly and daily quests of the games that are in the database when the user clicks on the game page. This app is made to give users easy access to the weekly and daily quests of specific games that they play.
